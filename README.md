# CSV-Quiz
Quiz that runs with csv input

Function will take a 2-column CSV file input as a quiz, the columns being for a question and the answer respectively. Then it will use the question in a string, asking for user input. If the input matches the answer, a counter will be incremented for correct. Otherwise, the counter for incorrect will go up. At the end of the question-asking loop, the amount of correct and incorrect answers will be printed in a string. There is also an argument for deciding if the answer is displayed after every question.
